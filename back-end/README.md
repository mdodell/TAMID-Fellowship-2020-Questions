1. Given two sorted arrays (*arr1*, *arr2*) and a number, *k*, create a method,
`sortArrays` that returns a sorted array of the first *k* elements.

   > Bonus points if you can comment the space/time complexity of your method.

   > Bonus points if you do this in O(n).
   
   > Bonus points if you write this in one line and it runs in O(n*logn)

1. You are given a sorted array of `n` non-negative integers (there can be duplicates), as well as a target number `m`. Your job is to propose an algorithm that finds if any pair of elements in the array sum to `m`. Your goal is to give the most time-efficient algorithm as possible. Propose your solution and give its Big-O runtime if you know it. Regardless of if you propose a solution or the most correct solution, be sure to explain your thought process. Again, solve this independently.

1. Write a function, `isPalindrome?` that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
A palindrome is defined as a word that is the exact same forwards as it is
backwards.

   > Bonus points if you can make the function body one line!

   ```
   Please enter a string: wow

   "Wow" is a palindrome!
   ```

   ```
   Please enter a string: TAMID

   "TAMID" is not a palindrome!
   ```
