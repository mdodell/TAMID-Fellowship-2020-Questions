1. Suppose we have the following schema with two tables: Ads and Events

    ```
    Ads(ad_id, campaign_id, status)
    Events(event_id, ad_id, source, date, hour)
    ```

    Each ad can be active or inactive, and this is reflected in the status field.

    We want to write a couple of queries to extract data from these tables. Write a SQL query that gets the number of active ads.

1. Calculate the Jaccard similarity between two sets: the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union.
