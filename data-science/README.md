1. Suppose we have the following schema with two tables: Ads and Events

```
Ads(ad_id, campaign_id, status)
Events(event_id, ad_id, source, event_type, date, hour)
```

Each ad can be active or inactive, and this is reflected in the status field.

There are different event types:

```
impression (ad is shown to the user)
click (the user clicked on the ad)
conversion (the user installed the app from the advertisement)
```

We want to write a couple of queries to extract data from these tables. Write SQL queries to extract the following information:

1) The number of active ads.



2) All active campaigns. A campaign is active if there’s at least one active ad.





3) The number of active campaigns.





4) The number of events per each ad — broken down by event type.
